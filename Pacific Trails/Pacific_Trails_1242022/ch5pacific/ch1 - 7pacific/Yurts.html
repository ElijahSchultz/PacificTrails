<h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
<dl>
    <dt><strong>What is a Yurt?</strong></dt>
    <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four
        feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed
        with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof
        dome that can be opened.</dd>
    <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
    <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed
        with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury
        camping experience includes electricity and a
        sink with hot and cold running water. Shower
        and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
    <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
    <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes
        and plan to dress for changing weather with
        light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring
        a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
